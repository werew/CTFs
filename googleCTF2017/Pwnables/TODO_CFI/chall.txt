CFI - hard (5 solves, 420 pts)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm not good at writing secure code, but luckily there's control-flow
integrity. Run with MCFI_SDK=/path/to/toolchain ./cfi (powered by
https://github.com/mcfi/MCFI)

Note: if anyone has issues with the proof-of-work on cfi, ping tsuro_ on IRC
