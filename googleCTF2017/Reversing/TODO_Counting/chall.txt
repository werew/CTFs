Counting - hard (33 solves, 246 pts)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This strange program was found, which apparently specialises in counting. In
order to find the flag, you need to output find what the output of ./counter
9009131337 is.

Update: Seems we have a minor bug in Counting - 32-bit truncation on getting
the argument from command line. To get the flag you need to calculate the
result of executing code for the full 64-bit 9009131337 value as the
description states. A result for a truncated 32-bit value won't give you the
correct result. We apologize for the inconvenience.
