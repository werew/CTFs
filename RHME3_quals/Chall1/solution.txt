Solution step by step

1. Understand white-box crypto and DFA (the folder papers contains a lot of good material)
2. Try to get an idea of what the program is actually doing (what cipher is using?).
   Some ways of doing it:
    - Reverse the executable 
    - Trace the execution (eg. function calls)
    - Trace memory access
   The program is using AES-128
3. Inject faults before the last round and collect outputs (eg. using a gdb script)
4. Use a tool such as JeanGrey to recover the last round key
5. Recover the original key (flag) using the inverted key schedule algorithm

flag: a1l_t4b135_R_oR5
